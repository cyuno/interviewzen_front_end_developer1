# interviewzen_front_end_developer1
This is an interviewzen front end developer question and solution. Warning: This is only one question and does not cover the wide variety of
questions that could be asked of a front end developer. The solution incorporates webshim and jquery 2.0 to deal with the current inability
of Safari to address the input required attribute in forms. Allegedly Safari has updated to address this issue.
